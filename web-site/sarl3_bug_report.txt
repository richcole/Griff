++++ Lattice not respecting object implication

<<shot5.png>>

The object java should be attached to the bottom node. So is this
error present in the formal context?

Hang on this isn't a bug. Java doesn't imply javax or org. The diagram
is ok.

But what in Java is dependent on JComponent?

Here is an elaboration of the diagram.

It seems that awt.component makes a call to
swing.JComponent. Interesting. If it weren't for this dependency then
AWT would not (for static calls at least) be dependent on Swing.

Oh and there was bug in the object contingent computation of the
bottom concept (caused by not handling the case of no lower
covers). It has been fixed now.

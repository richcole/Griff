The following is an example of a lattice constructed from a very small
sample of movies.

The screenshots shows the use of scrolling abels in action. Note the
"... 2 after" on the top right hand label.

The lattice is kind of interesting because

   - it is hard to get a good layout for
   - it is generated from a very small data set and so has funny implications
   - it is an example drawn from RDF like data

To take up the last point. Consider that we have a triple store. Now
consider that we generate a context in the following way:

---
  foreach "_movie is-a movie"
    foreach "_movie has-title _title"
      foreach "_movie _a _b, _a in {director, genre, actor}"
        context.insert("title: _title", "_a: _b")
      end
    end
  end
---

Then the lattice shows actors, directors, and genres for movies
identified by their title. Using titles to identify movies is
problematic since several movies might have the same name, so some
other identifier that perhaps include the date of release would be
potentially better. It doesn't effect this example though.

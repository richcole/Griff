+++ RJL Latest

The latest thing I'm discovering is C#, mono and the .NET
framework. There is a new programming language called
[Boo][http://boo.codehaus.org/]. Boo is in the space of languages
supporting both dynamic and static typing.

The other cool thing is
[Coco/R][http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Projects/Coco/] which
is a compiler compiler with bindings for C#, C++, and Java. I just
read the manual and it is way cool. It has been really well done and
I'm keen to try writing a grammar parser for RJL in C#. On the flip
side, [LLVM][http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/] the other cool technology the
become prominent recently, has a C++ interface which may be difficult
to access from C#.

In older news there are the pages that I've written about RJL so far.

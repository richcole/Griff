    This article makes some good points about usibility. On point
    boils down to: understand what the user wants to do 90% of the
    time and support that.

    An example is an icon view that when it contains a number of
    picutures gets a button that says: display as slidshow.

    There is also the suggestion that main windows be decorated with
    folders and panes that scroll out rather than making heavy use of
    dialogue boxes.

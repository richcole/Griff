+++ Compiling Sarl3

The source package sarl3-0.9.tar.gz can be downloaded from the
sourceforge file release system
[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=20790][http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=20790].

To install you need the following debian packages installed.

---
 sudo apt-get install tcl8.4 ruby1.8-dev tclsh g++ gtk2.0-dev gc-dev
---


The process is then:

---
tar -xzf sarl3-0.9.tar.gz
cd sarl3-0.9.tar.gz
make
make install
---

If this doesn't work the first port of call is build_config.txt which
contains some variables which can be set. The build_config.txt also
contains the location where the files are installed. The default
setting is to install in /usr/local.

If you have any problems compiling please drop me an email and I will
try to assist {rj-cole (at) sf.net}. It will also help me improve the
build process.

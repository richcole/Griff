+++ PIG - Personal Information Graphs

The PIG project aimed to construct a triple store. It is implemented
in a mixture of C and Ocaml. The current version of PIG has problems
when triples are removed form the store and therefore is not
recommended.

Instead the open source project [Kowari][http://kowari.org] is
recommended in its place.

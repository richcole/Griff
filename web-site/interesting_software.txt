+++ Interesting Software

  - [Xrefactory][http://xref-tech.com/xrefactory/emacs.html] This project 
    worked quite well being grafted onto Sarl3 which has a moderately 
    complex makefile.

    The best aspect is that is provides method name completion as well
    and extract function. A must for any serious refactoring activity.

+++ What is XML for?

I often wondered what is XML for. Where do the ideas come
from. Initially I thought that XML was meant for storing data in the
presense of an object oriented data store. But I've since discovered
that XML is for making forms, you know those forms you have to fill in
all the time, and XML document is simply a form that has been filled
in.

Once you understand XML in these terms then its design becomes much
less of mystery. You get a hint from a form what the process model is
behind it, but only a hint. Also, if one has a database then one
copies information between the form and the database: either fill out
the form from the database, or vice versa fill out the database from
the form.

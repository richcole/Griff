+++ Sarl3 Scrolling Labels

From the todo list:

  - relatively straight foward. Labels are characterised by a height,
    in number of lines, an first line (number of lines again) and a
    width in pixels. Cropping is used to limit the width. Labels start
    of with a height of 4 (or less if they have fewer lines) and an
    uncropped width. Under the scrollbar is a drag button than can be
    used to make the label bigger. Is there something in gdk for this?
    Can scrollbar be drawn using gdk?

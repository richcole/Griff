+++ Sarl Development Log

++++ Recent Additions

  - Revamp of the build System: The build system has been split up so
    that it generates dependencies in an initial step before then
    loading the makefile the loads the code. Some options were moved
    from a build.tcl file to build_config.txt so that they could
    potentially be edited by a ./configure program if one were
    created.

  - Sat Solver: A sat solver has been added to sarl including a number of 
    command line executables. Of most interested are: 

       min_unsat.exe prune_clauses.exe reduce_clauses.exe sarl_sat_main.exe

    These programs solve the SAT and min-UNSAT problems. Implementing well 
    documented algorithms from the literature.

  - Psudo-Intents and the Stem Base: Ganter's algorithm for the
    computation of the stem-base for attribute implications of a
    formal context has been added to Sarl. See the program
    sarl_implication_set_test.cpp for an example of how to use the algorithm.

++++ What are the most needed features

Following is a list of the most needed features for browsing 
software structure. This is really related to CASS.

   - Back button: To do well this really requires storing diagrams as
     well. Perhaps this is not too hard to do at the Ruby layer. It
     simply requires storing the diagrams on each navigation step.

   - Complete the naviagtion operations: So far not all the navigation
     operations are provided.

   - Create a druid or some such for analysing additional jar files.
     

++++ Adding Scrolling Labels

   I have added basic infra structure to draw scrollbars on labels
   when they are active. 

   The labels can currently be resized but currently can't be scrolled
   either up or down. The minimum size for a label is way too small.

     - change the minimum size for a label to be three lines
     - add scroll up and scroll down functions
     - modify the drawing code to draw from the current offset
     - modify the drawing code to add "n more before" and "n more below" if 
       neccessary

  Also linked to this page are the notes on [Sarl Scrolling
  Labels][sarl3_scrolling_labels.html].

  Label scrolling now works in a basic way. The arrows in the
  scrollbars work and you get "n before" and "n after" text when the
  label is scrolled. However there are still issues:

     - the buttons don't limit the scroll range properly
     - the label minimum size is too small

  A redesign of the label system is in order to fix these
  problems. Particularly since the font metrics coming from Pango make
  it rather easy to figure out the size of the text.

Scanner:

  The scanner is a single file include a test program. It needs to be
  broken down to make it accessible from a parser. The current plan is
  to make a recursive decent parser. Maybe cause I just started this
  out without having Bison around, and maybe cause in some sense I
  want to keep it simple.

  There will however still be a parse tree constructed. From the parse
  tree it is anticipated that code will generate LLVM code from the
  parse tree. This is yet to be tested.

  TODO:
    - Add more symbols to the scanner
    - Change the description of the griff project to include FCA and also RJL.
    - Add links to the RJL syntax etc pages on the main RJL page and 
      promote RJL to a project.
    - Add a facility to track the line number and file number of the current line in
      tokens.

  DONE:
    - Break out the scanner into an interface and implementation file

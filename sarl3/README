1. Install dependencies

  $ sudo apt-get install tcl8.4 ruby1.8-dev tclsh g++ gtk2.0-dev gc-dev \
      libgc1c2 libgc-dev libglib2.0-dev \
      libgtk2.0-dev ruby-dev libglib2-ruby1.8 ruby-gnome2 ruby-gnome2-dev

There may be other missing dependencies that I already had installed
on my machine.

2. Building

  $ cd sarl3
  $ make
  
3. Testing

This is a test of the Gtk widget for displaying lattices

  $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./sarl_lattice_view_gtk_test.exe

This is a simple lattice viewer from the ruby framework. It can draw
lattices of contexts in Beurmeister format.

  $ cd ruby && LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:.. ruby lattice_viewer_app.rb

There's an example file b4.cxt.

The Sarl library was used mostly for my experiments. If you also
install Mulgara then you can use the software analysis stuff which
includes an implementation of the idea of Navigation spaces.

The Navigation space viewer requires the Ruby Java Bridge to talk to
Mulgara which is written in java http://rjb.rubyforge.org/

<h2>
Introduction.</h2>
The Griff project has the objective of creating a software framework to
support the construction and utilisation of a knowlegde base.&nbsp; The
knowledge base is constitued by a single triadic relation. A portion of
the knowledge can be extracted using a query and that knowledge can be
organised and visualised, either in a tabular form, or using a concept
lattice arrising from denoting the query result as a power context family.
<h1>
Data Graphs.</h1>
The basic idea of Griff is to provide a knowledge base using a single triadic
relation, i.e. (V,E) where V is a set of vertices and E is a triadic relation
defined on V.<br>

Figure 1. Example Informatio Graph</center>

<p>An example triadic relation is shown in Figure 1. The nodes are constituted
by text strings and the relationships are shown by arrows. The arrows have
a source, a destination and a relation-name. A linear form of the same
information is shown below.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>Person:Richard contributes-to "Software Project":Griff
has "GPL Library Licence".</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>The syntax of the linear form follows the following rules.
<br>"A:B" means that there is a relationship with A as the destination,
<br>B as the source and "is-a" as the relation name. "A C B" means that
there is a relationship from A to B called C.&nbsp; Here are some more
complex examples:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>Person:Richard has "Address Book":_a, Richard has "Last
Name":Cole.</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>This example shows the syntax in more detail. There is an anonymous
vertex called
<br>_a. These verticies are unique within a sentance (sentances are seperated
by full stops). A comma is used to start a new relationship. If there was
no comma between _a, and Richard then the vertex Richard would be taken
to be a relation name, but the comma denotes that the vertex Richard starts
a new graph.
<h2>
Query Graphs</h2>
A query graph has the same structure as a data graph, only the semantics
vary.&nbsp; The anonymous nodes in a query graph are mapped via a morphism
into the triadic structure. The mapping is called a morphism because for
any edge in the query graph there must be a corresponding edge between
the verticies mapped to under the morphism in the data graph. Each such
morphism gives rise to a single query result.
<p>Here is an example query:
<blockquote><tt>_a:Richard _b "Software Project":_c.</tt></blockquote>
This query says retrieve all verticies _a, _b and _c such that Richard
is-a _a,
<br>_b relates Richard to _c, and _c is-a Software Project. The answer
to such a query is a set of morphisms. Using the data graph in Figure 1
we get a single morphism in the set.
<blockquote><tt>&nbsp; _a -> Person, _b -> contributes-to, _c -> Griff.</tt></blockquote>
Such a morphism can be written in a tabular form. For example:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>_a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
_c</tt>
<br><tt>----------------------------------</tt>
<br><tt>Person&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contributes-to&nbsp;&nbsp; Griff</tt></blockquote>
The query results can also be used to form a power context family as defined
by Rudolf Wille at ICCS 97. The objects consist of pairs of verticies,
the attributes
<br>consist of relation names and the images of the is-a relation.&nbsp;
i.e. G = VxV,
<br>M = {0,1}xV union V and ((u,v),w) in I iff (u,w,v) in E, and ((u,v),(0,w))
in I iff
<br>(u,is-a,w) and ((u,v),(1,w)) in I iff (v,is-a,w).&nbsp; The resulting
concept lattice can then be used to view the data.
<h1>
Backward Chaining</h1>
Backward chaining can be achieved using by simply extending the query graph.
The problem with chaining from a set of rules in general is that the solution
tends to be NP hard. A single query graph is efficient to answer but consider
the following rule and a basic query intended to employ it.
<p>Rule 1: _c:_b:_a implies _c:_a.
<br>Query:&nbsp; _a:_b.
<p>The rule says that is _a is-a _b and _b is-a _c then _a is-a _c. In
order to solve the query we can keep applying the rule and looking for
a longer and longer chain between _a and _b. At some point no further query
will be satisfiable since there won't be enough relationships to determine
it. There is also the problem that in generating a chain isomarphic graphs
can be producted via different applications of the single rule.
<p>The use of backward chaining in this form then is discouraged because
of the complexity, rather the query graph should be extended manually and
a subset of the nodes selected for grouping the results.
<p>Query: _c:_b:_a.&nbsp; select _c, _a.
<p>Thus the morphisms returned by the query organised into equivalence
classes formed by considering just the selected nodes.
<h2>
Implementation Plan</h2>
<b>Basic Framework.</b>
<p>1. Construct parser for the linear form. (Finished).
<br>2. Construct a memory mapped database for the triadic relationship.
(Finished).
<br>3. Construct a query engine to retrieve data from the database. (Not
started yet).
<br>4. Translate query results into formal contexts (Not started yet).
<p><b>Applications.</b>
<p>1. Tool for a mixed initiative knowledge markup tool for surfing. The
basic idea is that some relationships are determined automatically by the
computer while others are input directly by the computer.
<p>2. Personal information system. A gui frount end consiting of frames
is used to enter PIS information and the frount end also allows the retrieval
of information using
<br>pre-defined queries attached again to frames.

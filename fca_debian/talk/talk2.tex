\begin{enumerate}
\begin{verbatim}
pluto:/# apt-get install cdebconf
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  cdebconf: Depends: libgtk2.0-0 (>= 2.6.0) but it is not going to be installed
            Depends: libpango1.0-0 (>= 1.8.2) but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}


\slide{Interesting objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\item helping maintainers, developers, users to resolve conflicts in packaging system
\item automatically find uninstallable packages
\item \emph{explain}, why a package is uninstallable - both graphically and in words
\item give some minimal set of ``guilty'' packages
\item guidance in resolving conflict (``what happens, if I remove that dependency?'')
\end{enumerate}



\slide{Debian packaging system}

\begin{enumerate}
\item divided into three distributions: \emph{stable}, \emph{testing}, \emph{unstable}
\item \emph{stable}: no new packages, just security updates (or packages with grave bugs)
\item \emph{testing} becomes \emph{stable} after a freeze (last time: June 6th, 3.1 \emph{Sarge}, 2002, 3.0\emph{Woody})
\item few restrictions for a package to get into \emph{unstable}
\item transition \emph{unstable} -> \emph{testing}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item in sync on all distributions
\item no dependencies, that makes package uninstallable
\item fewer release-critical bugs than the version currently in \emph{testing}
\item available in \emph{unstable} for at 2, 5, 10 days (depending in urgency)
\item must not break dependency of any package in \emph{testing}
\item depending packages already in \emph{testing} or accepted at the same time
\end{itemize}
\item broken, i.e. \emph{uninstallable} packages only in \emph{unstable}
\item bug reporting system: everbody can participate, has influence on package transition (``\emph{release critical bugs}'')
\item 16700 packages in unstable, several hundred maintainers
\item most interesting thing: it works!
\item social aspect: community of several thousend people enhancing Debian all the time, working together
trough mailing lists, bug tracking system, CVS and packaging system
\end{enumerate}

Description: Debian Configuration Management System (C-implementation)
 Debconf is a configuration management system for Debian packages. It is
 used by some packages to prompt you for information before they are
 installed. This is a reimplementation of the original debconf version
 in C.
 .
 Installing this package is rather dangerous now. It will break debconf.
 You have been warned!

\item Priority, Architecture, Version, Provides, Depends, Conflicts, Filename
\item packages which \emph{have to be} installed and which \emph{can't} be installed together with particular package
\item \emph{conflicts} arise, when a package (transitively) depends on some non-existing package or when it depends on some package which is ``somehow'' in conflict
\item recently: \emph{tagging} of packages (we wrote some small FCA application)

\slide{Min-UNSAT}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{minimally-unsatisfiable subformulas} (MUS) of an unsatisfiable CNF formula $\varphi$
\item in general NP-hard
\item two implementations, both calculating \emph{maximally satisfiable subformulas} (MSS) first
\item example: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\varphi = (x_1) \land (\overline{x_1\) \land (\overline{x_1} \lor x_2) \land (\overline{x_2})$
  \item $\operatorname{coMSS}(\varphi) = \bigl{
      \{(x_1)\}, 
      \{(\overline{x_1}),(\overline{x_1} \lor x_2)\},
      \{(\overline{x_1}),(\overline{x_2}\)\}\bigr}$
  \item $\operatorname{MUS}(\varphi) = \bigl{
      \{(x_1),(\overline{x_1})\},
      \{(x_1),(\overline{x_1} \lor x_2), (\overline{x_2})\}\bigr}$

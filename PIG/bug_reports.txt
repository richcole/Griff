report:
  title: Error in remove
  location: void TreeNode::remove(mmap_file *mp, Tuple const& x)
  descr:
    The remove function doesn't take into account what happens when
    the payload becomes empty. Nor does it handle the situation when
    a node overflows as the result of a removal as might happen when a 
    hole is created.
  fixed:
    This bug has been fixed. The remove test has been updated.

report:
